						<a class="underline_link" href="http://ellevest.com/" title="Ellevest" target="_blank">Ellevest</a> is a digital investment platform geared towards women and the achievement of their various financial goals. Ellevest’s founder, Sallie Krawcheck, has “<a class="underline_link" href="http://www.refinery29.com/2015/09/94797/ellevest-sallie-krawcheck" target="_blank" title="Refinery29: This Website Wants To Change The Way Women Invest">a solid reputation as a disrupter in the male-dominate world of finance</a>.” Which is why Sallie and the rest of the Ellevest team are working to change the way women invest. According to Sallie, “<a class="underline_link" href="http://www.refinery29.com/2015/09/94797/ellevest-sallie-krawcheck" target="_blank" title="Refinery29: This Website Wants To Change The Way Women Invest">It’s time to give women an investing experience built specifically for them. Ellevest will be unlike anything else out there and will empower women to take financial control of their lives</a>.” Ellevest is a company I’m proud to be a part of, as I too have a dedication to doing what I can to ensure the amazing women in my life have the opportunities they deserve.

					<p>
						My work at Ellevest began in the Fall of 2015 as a contractor where my first task was a simple build of their Beta release “Sign Up” page. As my work for Ellevest continued, I constructed HTML E-mails (which were not so fun, but taught me a lot), in addition to integrating content into Ellevest’s “Resource Center” with Ruby on Rails. Once my work for Ellevest as an Engineering Apprentice for the Summer of 2016 started, I spent a large chunk of my time refining and adding to Ellevest's in-office tools, allowing me to gain a more solidified understanding of Ruby, Rails, and MYSQL, while also giving me more Back End experience I hadn't had much of before.

				<h4 class="mid_page_header">In-Office Tools</h4>
				<p>
					My time at Ellevest working on their in-office tools was a great chance for me to try out the different ends of the Web Development spectrum. On one end, I was cleaning up different pages so they were more functional and user friendly. On the other, I had the opportunity to build out a Content Management System, which was not only so fun, but incredibly beneficial to my understanding of databases, regular expressions, and Rails. But all of this work didn't come easily. I had to work my way the need for engineering involement in the work I was previously doing&mdash;a lot of HTML emails :-/&mdash;by streamlining processes around building them. After that I was able to really work on refining and growing in my skills as Full Stack Engineer.
				</p>
				<p>
					A huge part of this work dealt with visually cleaning up the Front-End of these in-office tools by making them responsive and more appealing to use. Additionally, some of the features needed to be refactored RESTfully. People in the office wanted to be able to simply modify a URL to retrieve a resource, and those URLs needed more consistency throughout the application to enable people to do that.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Front End issues the applicaion had mostly dealt with text and data pieces spreading out of view, which meant that potentially important things just couldn't be seen on a page, which was bad. So I used Semantic.ui and custom CSS to clean up some of these tools, making them more functional and easy to use.

			<h4 class="mid_page_header">Press Page</h4>
			<p>
				Another project I had was building out a simple and easy to use page to hold all of Ellevest's press articles. I built the Press Page in a similar manner to that of the Resource Center, so it could easily integrate into the CMS as it became more developed. That way, Ellevest employees could add to it easily as Ellevest was featured in the press more.

				Overall, my experience at Ellevest was a great one. The employees who work there are some of the most intelligent individuals I've had the opportunity to be around. Working at Ellevest allowed me to expand my knowledge of web engineering in learning from those awesome people, and also enabled me to take part in efforts towards achieving gender equality, a mission that I'm passionate about.
