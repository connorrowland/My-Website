				<h2 class="blog_post_title">5 Things I Learned From Freelancing</h2>
				<p class="post_subtitle">Freelancing. What I liked, didn't like, learned, or wish I did differently. Below is a list of the five things I learned from my first year of being a Freelance Web Engineer.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="post_container">
			<div class="post_body first_paragraph">
				<h4 class="mid_page_header">1. Sometimes People Forget About You</h4>
				<p>
					As a freelancer, I rarely spent time working in an office space other than my own apartment, which is great at times. But in my experience, sometimes the work a freelancer is doing, or the freelancer themselves, might be forgotten. 
				</p>

				<div class="twenty_spacer"></div>
				<img src="../imgs/kim-crying.jpg" alt="" class="larger_project_image">
				<p>...It's fine...I'm fine...</p>
				<div class="twenty_spacer"></div>

				<p>
					A lot of the free time that I have as freelancer comes from clients forgetting to get back to me. I’d be embarrassed to count the amount of times I wrote in an email, “Just following up,” so I will not, but those emails are important. Although at times it felt like I was reaching out too frequently, sending those emails were my way of maintaining consistent contact with my employer and ensuring that the projects I was working on didn't get left behind.
				</p>

				<h4 class="mid_page_header">2. A Defined Workspace is Necessary for an Efficient Workflow</h4>
				<p>
					Working from home can be awesome. Scattered 10 minute naps throughout the day are ~nice~. But this also conflicts with the need for an efficient workflow. Having a workspace, like a desk, can generously improve the amount of work you do as apposed to doing it all while sitting on the couch or your bed. Before I got a desk chair (I had a desk, but no chair for 4 months; weird time in my life), I spent most of my working hours sitting on my bed. I used to get distracted all the time by my overwhelming motivation to go to sleep, and consequently did less work over long periods of time. So find a desk, a nice light bulb (like <a class="underline_link" target="_blank" href="https://5fc98fa113f6897cea53-06dfa63be377ed632ae798753ae0fb3f.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/product_images/files/000/098/832/legacy_product_detail_large/data?1443636290">this</a>), and get to work.
				</p>

				<h4 class="mid_page_header">3. Design Submissions Will Be Rejected For Lack of ‘Wow Factor’</h4>
				<p>
					I have no idea what clients think this means for designers. Do we have buckets of these factors laying around, waiting to be used? Am I the only one without said bucket? HOW DO I FIND THE WOW????!!! Plz contact me if you have found the wow, or know someone who has. 
				</p>

				<p>
					This is actually part of a bigger issue that I've encountered which is dealing with clients who don't know what they want. A lot of times, or for me at least, this has resulted in countless design revisions, and an overall misuse of time. When I was presented with this issue, I knew there had to be some way to get out of my clients what they really wanted. So I asked them to write down five adjectives that they'd like to describe their website as if they were talking about it to someone, and we went from there. 
				</p>

				<p>
					If you're still lost and could use a funny infographic to guide your not so fun client experience, Design Taxi published a great article for <a class="underline_link" href="http://designtaxi.com/news/365427/Infographic-Translating-Client-Speak-Like-A-Pro/" target="_blank">Translating Client-Speak Like A Pro</a>.
				</p>

				<h4 class="mid_page_header">4. Contracts Are Super Important</h4>
				<p>
					I like to think of contracts as the moms of freelance projects. They tell us and our clients what we can and cannot do, and when we have issues we go back to them to sort things out. Being as specific as possible in your contract will allow you to ensure this project will work well for you and your client, on fair terms you’re both comfortable with. Contracts also take out a lot of the awkwardness and conflict involved in doing work for family or friends. A contract will define what’s expected from both parties, and also what to do in case something goes awry.
				</p>

				<h4 class="mid_page_header">5. I Do Not Want to Freelance Forever</h4>
				<p>
					Freelancing has been a great start to my career as an engineer and designer. I’ve had the opportunity to meet a variety of different clients, testing out what work environments I like, and which ones I don’t. But I also spent a lot of time on my own. Time that could have been spent building relationships and connections with coworkers, and other important people in my career field. Having a good rapport with your employer is good, but having a strong relationship with him or her is amazing, and can open so many doors to new and exciting opportunities.
