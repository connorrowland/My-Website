				<p class="post_subtitle">What I liked, didn't like, learned, or wish I did differently. Below is a list of the five things I learned from my first year of being a Freelance Web Engineer.</p>

				<p>
					The first word that comes to mind when I think of freelancing is 'empowering.' Making your own schedule, being your own boss, and essentially operating your own small business grants a great amount of freedom to a freelancer to truly live the life they choose. But with this empowering freedom comes other developments that aren't always so great. Ultimately though, freelancing provided me an amazing path to lot to learn about myself as an engineer, and that is something I'll always appreciate.
				</p>

				<h4 class="mid_page_header">1. Sometimes People Forget About You</h4>
				<p>
					As a freelancer I rarely spent time working in an office space other than my own apartment, which is awesome at times. But in my experience, sometimes the work a freelancer is doing&mdash;or the freelancer themselves&mdash;might be forgotten because that daily physical presence isn't there to serve as a reminder.
				</p>

				<div class="twenty_spacer"></div>
				<img src="../imgs/kim-crying.jpg" alt="" class="larger_project_image">
				<p>I've been forgotten...It's fine...I'm fine...</p>
				<div class="twenty_spacer"></div>

				<p>
					So what I decided to do was become close friends with follow up / reminder emails. I’d be embarrassed to count the amount of times I wrote in an email, “Just following up about [X]” so I will not. But those emails are integral to the success and timelines of a project. And although at times it felt like I was reaching out too much, sending those emails were my way of maintaining consistent contact with my employer and ensuring that the projects I was working on didn't get left behind. 
				</p>

				<h4 class="mid_page_header">2. A Defined Workspace is Necessary for an Efficient Workflow</h4>
				<p>
					Working from home in your own space can be awesome&mdash;it's the ultimate comfort zone to do your best work. But it also conflicts with the need for an efficient workflow, especially when a freelancer doesn't have a designated workspace. Having a place to sit down and get things done vastly improves the quality and quantity of work completed when compared to what would have been accomplished sitting on the couch or bed. Before I got a desk chair (I had a desk but no desk chair for 4 months; strange time in my life), I spent most of my working hours sitting on my bed. Being that your body associates laying on a bed with going to sleep, the motivation to fall asleep is incredibly distracting when you're trying to get something done. So find a desk, a nice light bulb (like <a class="underline_link" target="_blank" href="https://5fc98fa113f6897cea53-06dfa63be377ed632ae798753ae0fb3f.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/product_images/files/000/098/832/legacy_product_detail_large/data?1443636290">this</a>), and get to work.
				</p>

				<h4 class="mid_page_header">3. Client's Looking For A 'Wow Factor' May Not Actually Know What They Want</h4>
				<p>
					I have no idea what clients think this means for freelancers. Do we have buckets of these factors laying around just waiting to be used? Am I the only one without said bucket? HOW DO I FIND THE WOW?! Please contact me if you have found the wow, or know someone who has. 
				</p>

				<p>
					Jokes aside, this kind of request is actually part of a bigger issue that I've encountered in freelancing, which is dealing with clients who don't know what they want. This has frequently resulted in many revisions, and an overall misuse of time. When I was presented with this issue a few months ago, I knew there had to be some way to get out of my clients what they truly wanted, and I needed to help them find out what that was. So I asked them to write down five adjectives that they'd use to describe their website once it's been completed. This encouraged my clients to visualize their completed site and then allowed me to translate that visualization into a completed product.
				</p>

				<p>
					If you're still lost and could use a funny infographic to guide your not so fun client experience, Design Taxi published a great article for <a class="underline_link" href="http://designtaxi.com/news/365427/Infographic-Translating-Client-Speak-Like-A-Pro/" target="_blank">Translating Client-Speak Like A Pro</a>.
				</p>

				<h4 class="mid_page_header">4. Contracts Are More Important Than You Think</h4>
				<p>
					I like to think of contracts as the moms of freelance projects. They tell us and our clients what we can and cannot do, and when issues arise, we go back to them to sort things out. And there's no fighting mom. She will shut you down and what she says <em>goes</em>. To that end, being as specific as possible in your contract will allow you to ensure a project will work well for you and your client on fair terms you’re both comfortable with. Contracts can also take out the awkwardness and conflict involved in doing work for family or friends, where gray areas like money and expectations are explicitly defined. A contract will outline what’s expected from both parties, and also what to do in case something goes awry, potentially saving you a lot of time and energy down the line.
				</p>

				<h4 class="mid_page_header">5. I Do Not Want to Freelance Forever</h4>
				<p>
					Freelancing has been a great start to my career as an engineer. I’ve had the opportunity to meet a variety of different clients, testing out what work environments I like and which ones I don’t. But I also felt a bit disconnected from the interpersonal relationships that are built when individuals work with people in an office. Having a well-established rapport with your employer is great, but having a strong relationship with him or her is amazing, and can open so many doors to new and exciting opportunities.
