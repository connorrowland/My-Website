					I like to think of my personal website as a "playground" for trying out new things in engineering and design. Sometimes it's using a new font I found&mdash;like the one I’ve used for headings called Dharma Gothic. Others could be making a small language practice project, like this <a class="underline_link" href="../iphone.html" target="_blank">iPhone Reproduction</a> I made to brush up on my memory of the DOM and JQuery. This post, however, is about my experience with a user experience/flow project, where I wanted to test out a potential solution to my issue of users dropping off at a mildly alarming rate at different points on my site.
				</p>

				<h4 class="mid_page_header">
					Outline
				</h4>
				<p>
					What distributed drop-off means to me is a poorly defined user flow. I saw that people were coming to my site, selecting certain project pages I had, and then dropping off instead of going through the loop of them. So what I needed to do was create an understandable, easy to follow user loop that would guide people throughout my different project pages that I wanted to display to give users a broad, cohesive view of my work.
				</p>

				<h4 class="mid_page_header">
					What I Did
				</h4>
				<p>
					In order to create this loop I had a few different options. I could just put all of my content on one long page that would continuously scroll until there was no more left to show. But that option felt wrong, as the more content I had the more gigantic this page would be. I also felt this would be disorganized. So I scrapped that idea and decided to focus more on navigation to fix that disorganization problem. Specifically, I wanted to place small bits of navigation throughout my portfolio at the end of every portfolio page that would link to the next project in my “loop.” So that’s what I did! And the effects were awesome.

					Results
				</h4>
				<p>
					I think the best way to display the results I saw is to define the loop, and then show you images of the user flow before and after I pushed up the changes to my site with the end-of-page links.
					<br>
					At this period of time (March, 2016) the loop goes as follows (each of these words represents the name of the portfolio file): iPhone, Ellevest, Let's Meet, Trilogy, Baruch, Magazines, and then Pride.

					It worked! The loop worked! I was honestly so excited when I saw this&mdash;that I could see people going through the exact track/loop I defined. Less people were dropping off on the site as a whole, as well, from <strong>86.7% to 68.5%</strong>. And that was just from doing about 30 minutes of coding, which is awesome! 
				</p>

				<p>
					More so than anything, this project taught me about how helpful a user experience can be to the success of a website. So I'm happy that I had the opportunity to branch out of my comfort zone and play around with UX, and that having a personal web "playground" gave me the place to do that.
