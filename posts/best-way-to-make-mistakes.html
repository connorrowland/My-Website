					There's no right way to do a wrong thing. But there is a lot of wrong ways to do something that can help you learn how to do things&hellip;right. Sorry, I know that was weird. It’s true, though. Making a mistake is a great way to learn how to do something better, as you have the ability to reflect on what went wrong and use that knowledge to inform your next attempt at success. So if you find yourself making mistakes, make them with <em>confidence</em> knowing your next try will be better than your last.
				</p>

					Web Engineering grants people the ability to try out a bunch of different experiences and skills. Which is amazing! But it can also bring one to make a lot of errors along the way, as learning new skills always results in a bit of trial and error. I recently made a project called <a href='../instamilligram.html' target='_blank' title='instammilligram' class="underline_link">InstaMilligram</a>, which is a Rails application I built to be my own technical foundation for future technical projects. It was an interesting experience building it, as each new height I reached with the project came with something unexpected&mdash;like needing to brush up on my <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html" title="Rails Asset Pipeline" class="underline_link" target="_blank">Asset Pipeline</a> knowledge in order to get my page styling to show up. What these unexpected “mistakes” have taught me is that a mistake is not an opportunity to get down on yourself. A mistake are an incredible way to learn something you didn’t know before, and ensure you wont do it again.
				</p>

				<p>
					Being anxious about making mistakes in what you do is an incredibly unsustainable way to be. And I understand it may seem like work places a lot of pressure on people to be perfect at what they do. But a huge part of being great at what you do is learning how to do it wrong. So learn to find the success that can come from your mistakes. Mistakes are good, and will teach you to be better at what you do than you could have been before. So find a comfortable space to make mistakes in&mdash;whether it’s developing a small side project, or pitching your new marketing plan to a friend. You’ll learn so much about doing your best work.
