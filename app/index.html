          I’ll be graduating from Baruch College in May of 2018 with a degree in Computer Information Systems, concentrated in Data Analytics, with a minor in Graphic Design. I currently work part-time as a full stack engineer, doing things like:

              I got to do a great deal of engineering work for from September 2017 onward through Alden Wolf, which is a digital design agency located in New York. Much of my contract work through Alden Wolf comprised of building interfaces in React, Rails, and SCSS/CSS for clients like Knaq and Rhino (which you can find information about below). I also built Alden Wolf’s website, and you can find that <a href="http://aldenwolf.com/" target="_blank" title="Alden Wolf Website">here</a> if you'd like to take a look.

              Ellevest is a digital investing platform geared towards women, with a mission to democratize investing and close the gender investing gap. The first engineering job I ever had took place at Ellevest, starting in the Fall of 2015 as a contractor. My work there started small, doing things like building their Beta release “Sign Up” page, or making HTML emails. But over the next year and a half, my work progressed into more significant, interesting projects like a preliminary Content Management System, a promotional "Galentine's Day Page," Rails API endpoints, all sorts of fun React components and a bunch of CSS layouts. I also spent a large amount of time refining and adding to Ellevest's back-office application, building up strength in Ruby, Rails, and MYSQL.

Right now, Alexa only responds to certain questions like "Alexa, ask your emotional self if you think I am pretty!" or "Alexa, ask your emotional self Why I am feeling sad." Eventually, my goal for Emotional Alexa is for her to be completely reliant on machine learning to generate the question responses, after being trained on things like psychological texts and demographic-specific vernacular.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              The inspiration for Emotional Alexa was a feeling I had about what emotional support means to me, and what I think it means to other people. I used to feel like my words lacked impact when my friends were going through times of difficulty in their lives and sought advice. But I soon realized that sometimes people just needed to be heard, and not everyone wants advice. So I figured Amazon Echo’s Alexa could help me out, being there to hear people out on issues like self-confidence, stress, or general emotional conflict.

              InstaMilligram is a photo sharing site intended to replicate the experience of using Instagram. From a developer standpoint, InstaMilligram is a tool I can use to build more projects in the future with, as it is a fully functioning Rails CRUD app with login capability. I recently shut down Instamilligram's photo sharing capabilities as a result of the costs associated with photo storage. This is why you won't see photos if you go to the <a href="http://instamilligram.herokuapp.com/" title="Instamilligram" target="_blank">site</a>.

              CareerPeer is a start-up that aims to connect college students with employees at companies those students want to work for, in hopes to better their chances of getting jobs. I was responsible for designing their whole product and then building out the front end for it from the ground up in Flask and React. This was a huge undertaking in a small amount of time, so it really tested my limits of what I could do in engineering and design. By the time I was finished, I felt really proud of what I created and lucky to have been able to do it, because I became so much more comfortable using React, Webpack, and CSS to make front-end products from end to end. I also got to work on front-end modules I hadn’t before—like a filtering module on the “Matches” pages that helped me expand my knowledge of JavaScript.
